      <ul>
        <li><span class="lead">Leadership effectiveness is related to leaders' ability to represent and advance the social identity of a group. Effective leaders transform by embodying the group they influence.</span></li>
        <li><span class="lead">Team cohesion and cooperation are emergent results of social identity. Trust and reciprocal respect are associated with social identity. Being perceived as trustworthy, fair and charismatic is a consequence of in-group prototypicality.</span></li>
        <li><span class="lead">Team leaders may turn to the group and its social context rather than relying on de-contextualized knowledge and principles.</span></li>
        <li><span class="lead">To prototype team identity, team members actively listen to co-workers to understand their needs, values, beliefs, priorities, aspirations. They assist in establishing norms and conventions that regulate working together within the team, particularly by authentic role-modeling.</span></li>
